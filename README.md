# Planner App

This project was built by Flatiron Students Angela Ellis and Christy Inman for the second module project of our Immersive Software Development program. Our goal was to build an app where a person or multiple people could log in and create a list and tasks/items for that list inorder to plan what they need to get done.

### Use

There are two ways that you may access this app. 
1. We have it deployed on Heroku at https://young-anchorage-93125.herokuapp.com/ .
2. You may clone this GitHub repository and open it in your own code editor. Then run ```rails s``` in your terminal and open a browser window navigating to localhost:3000(or whichever route the terminal directs you to in case you have specific routes established in your local environment).

### Contributions

We believe in and support open source code and projects. If you would like to contribute your own updates or bug fixes please feel free to clone the repo and create your own branch. Once finished editting create a pull request and we will review it, and add what we feel benfits the project as a whole, and add you to the contributors list.
